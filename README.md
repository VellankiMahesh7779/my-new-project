Jenkins Build Testing Repository

This repository is created purely for testing Jenkins builds. It is used to verify whether any changes in the code introduce internal errors or build failures.

Purpose:

Test Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.

Detect compilation or runtime errors in code changes.

Ensure smooth integration before merging to main branches.

Usage:

Push your changes to a main.

Jenkins will automatically trigger a build.

Check the build logs for any errors or warnings.

Fix issues if any are found, then re-run the build.
